We have open RESTful APIs to get the real-time data of COVID-19 cases all over the world. 

You can find the APIs at https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc

You can use any preferred language / platform and implement any type of database to store the above data locally. 

The solution should be performant and scalable.

Preferred tech stack: Reactjs, Nodejs. You are required to build a dashboard to display some of the following

- Show a list of countries with stats count of Confirmed, Critical, Active, Recovered & Death.

- Show a similar heatmap as link

- Create a plot graph to show the trend of either (Confirmed, Recovered or death) against any
 given country for last 6 months

Recommendations

Publish code over Git and write README how to set up and execute the code.

Use of docker is highly encouraged.
